# RandomPassword
# This is a Random Password Generator website . I have made it by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Building up a project on Random Password Generator was a great piece of experience, it not only help me in gathering information about new technologies but also made me realize the use of programming in real life.

Discussing about how this learning process started and journey up to building up this project goes like this:-

Firstly I start  my project by making a structure of my website how it will be going to look like.

And for it HTML is most Important to make structure of any webpage.
So i start making  structure of my website using HTML.


Secondly, after making the structure it looks good but not too much attractive 
So to make it attractive start my CSS.

In CSS I have done things like coloring the whole body of the webpage and some container and different elements of the webpage also.
I also use transition property to make it beautiful.
Also add a clipboard button so the user can easily copy the generated password with only one single click.


Thirdly, Up till now Structuring and Designing of the webpage has been done.
Now comes the most important thing to do and it is giving life to our webpage.
Yes making all the buttons works and generating the password and having a functionality of copying the generated password.
All these things are done by using JAVASCRIPT a wonderful exciting language for the WebDevelopers.

Lastly, Our website is ready but the bigger problem comes here.
My website is ready I can run it but only on my computer so here comes the challenge of Hosting my website and getting a Domain name.

And this problem I solved by using the free services of Hostinger which gives the domain name and hosting services paid. But I use its free service where I can host only one website. For this project it is enough so this problem get also solved.

# Finally Our website is ready fully working.
